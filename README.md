### How to use
Download the repo and type npm run start in the main folder.

### Description
Option chosen as a main project. (option one rejected: https://github.com/mantolek/old)
Added animations.

### What should be changed
Due to ongoing changes and no prepared design, CSS naming convention and CSS in general is a bit mixed.
Should not use polish names
